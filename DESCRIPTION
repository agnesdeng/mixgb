Description: Multiple imputation using XGBoost, bootstrapping and predictive mean 
    matching as described in Deng and Lumley (2021) <arXiv:2106.01574>. It is built 
    under Fully Conditional Specification (FCS), where XGBoost imputation models are
    built for each incomplete variable. It supports various types of variables and 
    offers different settings regarding bootstrapping and predictive mean matching. 
    Visual diagnostic functions are also provided for inspecting multiply imputed 
    values for incomplete variables.
