Description: Multiple imputation using 'XGBoost', subsampling, and predictive mean 
    matching as described in Deng and Lumley (2023) 
    <doi:10.1080/10618600.2023.2252501>. Our method utilizes the capabilities of
    XGBoost, a highly efficient implementation of gradient boosted trees, to capture
    interactions and non-linear relations automatically. Moreover, we have integrated
    subsampling and predictive mean matching to minimize bias and reflect appropriate
    imputation variability. This package supports various types of variables and offers
    flexible settings for subsampling and predictive mean matching. Additionally, it 
    includes diagnostic tools for evaluating the quality of the imputed values.
