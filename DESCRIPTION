Description: Multiple imputation using 'XGBoost', subsampling, and predictive mean 
    matching as described in Deng and Lumley (2024) 
    <doi:10.1080/10618600.2023.2252501>.  The package supports various types of 
    variables, offers flexible settings, and enables saving an imputation model to impute
    new data. Data processing and memory usage have been optimised to speed up 
    the imputation process.
