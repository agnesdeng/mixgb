# mixgb: Multiple Imputation Through 'XGBoost'

Multiple imputation using 'XGBoost', subsampling, and predictive mean
matching as described in Deng and Lumley (2023)
[doi:10.1080/10618600.2023.2252501](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2023.2252501)
. The package supports various types of variables, offers flexible
settings, and enables saving an imputation model to impute new data.
Data processing and memory usage have been optimised to speed up the
imputation process.
